# Consent-Based Activity Monitoring Tool

## 📌 Overview

This project is a consent-based activity monitoring tool built in Python to demonstrate how malicious keyloggers correlate keystrokes with screen context — implemented ethically for cybersecurity learning purposes.

The application logs keystrokes typed within the application window and captures screenshots at fixed intervals. All data is stored locally in a timestamped session folder for analysis.

⚠️ This project is designed strictly for educational and lab use only.  
It does NOT run stealthily, does NOT monitor system-wide input, and does NOT transmit data externally.

---

## 🎯 Objectives

- Understand how keylogging malware associates input data with screen context
- Demonstrate timestamp-based correlation
- Practice Python threading and file handling
- Implement ethical and consent-based monitoring design
- Build a structured logging system for analysis

---

## 🚀 Features

- Application-level keystroke logging
- Periodic screenshot capture (every 5 seconds)
- Timestamp-based correlation
- Automatic session folder creation
- Threaded execution (parallel logging + capture)
- Modern Tkinter-based UI
- Start/Stop monitoring controls
- Local storage only (no network transmission)

---

## 🛠 Technologies Used

- Python 3.x
- Tkinter (GUI)
- threading (parallel execution)
- pyautogui (screenshot capture)
- Pillow (image backend)
- os & datetime modules

## ⚙️ Installation

### 1️⃣ Clone or download the project

### 2️⃣ Install dependencies
  
  pip install pyautogui pillow 

---

## ▶️ How to Run
commad- python main.py

1. Click **Start Monitoring**
2. Type inside the application text box
3. Screenshots are captured every 5 seconds
4. Click **Stop Monitoring**
5. Check the `logs/` folder for saved data

---
## 🧠 How It Works

1. A timestamped session folder is created at startup.
2. When monitoring begins:
   - Keystrokes typed inside the app are logged.
   - A separate thread captures screenshots periodically.
3. Both logs and images are stored using timestamps for correlation.
4. Monitoring stops when the user clicks "Stop Monitoring."

## 🔒 Ethical Considerations

This project:
- Requires explicit user interaction to start monitoring
- Only logs keystrokes inside the application window
- Does not run in stealth mode
- Does not collect system-wide data
- Does not send data over the internet

This tool is intended solely for cybersecurity education and malware behavior analysis in controlled environments.

## 🛡 Cybersecurity Learning Value

This project helps demonstrate:

- How spyware correlates keystrokes with visual context
- File system artifacts generated by monitoring tools
- Threaded execution patterns
- Timestamp-based logging mechanisms
- Ethical implementation of security research tools

---

## 📈 Possible Improvements

- Encrypt stored logs
- Add session summary report
- Implement log analysis module
- Add risk detection logic
- Export structured CSV logs
- Add screenshot preview panel
